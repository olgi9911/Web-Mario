2. Player : 
Control the player with  UP, LEFT and DOWN. The default one can be upgraded to BIG Mario if mushroom is eaten.
3. Enemies : 
There are three different kinds of enemies: goomba, turtle and flower. 
Goomba is the most basic one, stomp to kill it.
Turtle is more tricky to deal with. First jump on it, and it will get stuck. Then kick it from left or right-hand side and it will start spinning, killing other enemy on its path as well.
Flower normally hides in the pipe. When the player gets close, it will start a up-down movement routinely.
4. Question Blocks : 
There are two kinds of mystery box, normal one which you can get 100 score, and the special one that will create a mushroom and  earn you 1000 score.
5. Animations :
